# Individual Certification

TARS Foundation provides certifications after project training.

According to the nature of your work, there are two categories: Certified Project Administrator \(CxA eg. CTA\), and Certified Project Application Developer \(CxAD eg. CTAD\). 

The former is suitable for operation and maintenance workers, and the latter is suitable for technology developers.

### Certified Project Administrator

The TARS Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment. The purpose of the Certified Project Administrator \(CxA\) program is to provide assurance that CxAs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of project administrators.

It is an online, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple issues from a command line.

The CxA program is separate from xCSP program. You can become a CxA without needing to be involved with a xCSP, but for a company to become a xCSP it must employ at least three CxAs. You can [learn more](enterprise-certification.md#project-certified-service-provider) about the xCSP program.

TARS Foundation has open sourced the curriculum around which the CxA exam has been created for the benefit of companies offering training. 

###  Certified Project Application Developer

The test of Certified Project Application Developer certifies that users can design, build, configure and apply this project to build ideas skillfully.
