# Training

Training includes project trainings and general ones.

TARS Foundation conducts training about our Foundationâ€™s projects via online video training, offline meetup, seminars in English and Chinese.

The number of place for each time is limited. Participants are required to pass the TF review.

The goal of the training is to enable participants to master the installation and deployment of projects, and to apply them perfectly to the development.

The goal of the training is to enable the participants to learn some concept, general work and latest projects in our foundation. Therefore, concepts, projects and some general working understandings are included in general training. The training methods are similar to the project ones.
